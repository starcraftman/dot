 My Home Configuration
======================

I keep all my config files for Linux in `files`.

Stuff in the top directory is optional stuff.

See [SysInstall.py](https://github.com/starcraftman/.my_scripts/blob/master/SysInstall.py) for help
setting up, specifically setups up links & shell projects. Can also save/restore existing config.

Some Notes:
* Stores my `vimrc` config & vim folder.
* See `vimrc` for details, mainly `Bootstrap`.
* My core bash (.bash_aliases) & zsh (.zshrc) configs, really useful stuff here!
* Lots of assorted configs for vcs (git, hg, bzr).
* Some of my own completions for bash & zsh.
