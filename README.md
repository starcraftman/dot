 My Home Configuration
=====

I keep all my config files for Linux in `files`.

Stuff in the top directory is just useful things I don't want linked.

See [SysInstall.py](https://github.com/starcraftman/.my_scripts/blob/master/SysInstall.py) for help
setting up, specifically setups up links & shell projects. Can also save/restore existing config.
