# This file is a global file to ignore things that probably shouldn't
# be committed to git, hg, bzr. To be global, has to use glob.
#
# The contents appends to the per-repo glob exclusions.
# NOTE: that this obviously prevents these files from bein displayed in git
# status, git add --all, etc. etc. Since that's the point of it; that way you
# won't end up accidentally committing useless files/dirs, and cluttering
# your output from 'git status' for example.
